## Card Generation
There is an <a href="https://www.unstablegames.com/community-cards/here-to-slay">official creator</a> by the Here To Slay makers for leaders only, BUT it has so many inaccuracies that it barely represents the look of the real cards, AND it lacks <b>many</b> features
This program is what the official one should be, accurate and with more features:

## Custom Classes
The progam allows you to add your very own custom classes to the generator. With custom colors, custom icons and cusom names. The process of adding them is a bit rough around the edges, but it's fairly simple.<br>
First you will have to make a class icon. You can make it whatever you want, even a picture of your cat, but you have to follow all the steps for it to work.<br>
While making the icon, be sure to add an outline using the <code>#f5f1e7</code> color to match the design on the original cards.<br>
<br>
After you made the icon, you put it in the <code>Classes</code> folder, and you name it whatever you want. Just remember the name, you'll need it later.<br>
<hr>
Then, you open the <code>ClassList.txt</code> file locaded also in the <code>Classes</code> folder. In the <code>ClassList.txt</code> file you have a list of all the classes that are currently in the maker.<br>
Each class has 4 values:
<ul>
    <li>English Name</li>
    <li>Name of the image file</li>
    <li>RGB color</li>
    <li>(optional) Polish Name</li>
</ul>

Each of the values are separated by a TAB character. Example:<br>

Name&emsp;image.png&emsp;255,128,0&emsp;PolishName

<hr>
NOTES:
<ul>
    <li>The color RGB values MUST be separated by a comma.</li>
    <li>You don't have to put in the PolishName, you can just ignore it entirely.</li>
    <li>You image will not appear in the lists where you choose a class, but it will appear on the card itself, so don't worry.</li>
    <li>If it doesn't appear on the card, your image is either in bad format, or you named it wrong.</li>
</ul>

After you have done all that, you should see your very own Here To Slay custom class in the maker!

## Printing
### Printing at Home
In the files included with the program there are attached printing assets for printing at home. Backs of the cards for leaders, monsters and heros, their cards placements on A4 papers, as well as a template for positioning your own generated cards.<br>
<img width="33%" align="right" src="HereToSlay/PrintingAssets/mixed_cardPlacement_A4_exampleBack.png">
<br>
Printing methods may differ depending on your printer, but what I found to work was to:
<ol>
    <li>Put a thicker A4 paper sheet into the printer.</li>
    <li>Align my generated cards like on the image on the right.</li>
    <li><b>ROTATE the image by 180°</b> to negate the default bottom margin on many printers.</li>
    <li>Print the front card with the setting to automatically crop the image <b>turned OFF</b>.</li>
    <li>Rotate the paper <b>ONLY on the Y axis</b> and put it back into the printer.</li>
    <li>Print the backsides of the cards, which are attached in the assets.</li>
</ol>
I hope this works for you as well, before printing with color I would test it by making a black ink only draft first, just to check if everything is aligned properly and has the right scale.<br>
You can of course print mixed card types on 1 piece of paper like: 1 Monster, 2 Leaders and 2 Heros on one piece of paper, but you gotta do some manual work and figure it out for your particular case yourself. 

### Printing Proffesionally
Unforunatelly I don't know how that works exactly. But I saw there are many posts about printing proffesionally on sites like reddit, so I reccomend you search there.
