## Features
There is an <a href="https://www.unstablegames.com/community-cards/here-to-slay">official creator</a> by the Here To Slay makers for leaders only, BUT it has so many inaccuracies that it barely represents the look of the real cards, AND it lacks <b>many</b> features
This program is what the official one should be, accurate and with more features:

## Printing
### Printing at Home
In the files included with the program there are attached printing assets for printing at home. Backs of the cards for leaders, monsters and heros, their cards placements on A4 papers, as well as a template for positioning your own generated cards.<br>
<img width="33%" align="right" src="https://github.com/Danrejk/Here-To-Slay-Card-Maker/blob/main/HereToSlay/PrintingAssets/English/leaderBack_A4_template.png">
Printing methods may differ depending on your printer, but what I found to work was to:
<ol>
    <li>Align my generated cards like on the image on the right.</li>
    <li><b>ROTATE the image by 180°</b> to negate the default bottom margin on many printers.</li>
    <li>Print the front card with the setting to automatically crop the image <b>turned OFF</b>.</li>
    <li>Rotate the paper <b>ONLY on the Y axis</b> and put it back into the printer.</li>
    <li>Print the backsides of the cards, which are attached in the assets.</li>
</ol>
I hope this works for you as well, before printing with color I would test it by making a black ink only draft first, just to check if everything is aligned properly and has the right scale.

### Printing Proffesionally
Unforunatelly I don't know how that works exactly. But I saw there are many posts about printing proffesionally on sites like reddit, so I reccomend you search there.
