<h1>Here To Slay - Custom Card Maker</h1>
<p>A maker for <b>accurate</b> custom cards for the card game "Here To Slay", which goal is to ensure that the generated cards follow the original designs as best as possible.</p>

<h2>Instalation</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/Danrejk/Here-To-Slay-Card-Maker/releases/tag/v2.3"> <img alt="Latest Version" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Latest_Version-v.2.3-green"> </a>
<br>
Download the <code>.zip</code> file from the latest <b>Release</b> of the program displayed above, or on the right side of the page.<br>
Unzip it, the <code>.exe</code> is inside of it, it must remain along the other files inside of the folder or else the program will not work.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>There is an <a href="https://www.unstablegames.com/community-cards/here-to-slay">official creator</a> by the Here To Slay makers for leaders only, BUT it has so many inaccuracies that it barely represents the look of the real cards, AND it lacks <b>many</b> features</p>
This program is what the official one should be, accurate and with more features:
