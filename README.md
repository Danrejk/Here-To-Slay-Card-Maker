<h1>Here To Slay - Custom Card Maker (ENG)</h1>
<p>A generator for accurate custom cards for the card game "Here To Slay", which goal is to ensure that the generated cards are as close to the original designs as possible.</p>
<p>There is <a href="https://www.unstablegames.com/community-cards/create/here-to-slay">an official one</a> by the creators for leaders only, BUT even it has so many inaccuracies that it barely represents the look of the real cards, and it lacks several classes, split classes and other features.</p>

<h2>Instalation</h2>
